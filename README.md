# RISC-V-Architecture

### CentraleSupélec Digital Systems and Computer Architecture Group Project
**32-bit Soft-Core CPU**

This repository contains the code for a 32-bit soft-core CPU, created as a group project for the course of Digital Systems and Computer Architecture at CentraleSupélec.

The goal of this project was to implement a subset of the RV32IM architecture (RISC-V), described using VHDL and the Intel Quartus Prime software. However, we did not follow the machine code format from RISC-V due to time constraints and a lack of familiarity with the architecture at the time.

Manual verification was carried out using ModelSim and the Terasic DE10-Lite board.

### Proposed Improvements

- Implementing the complete RV32IM architecture and machine code format.
- Adding more test cases to thoroughly test the CPU.
- Reviewing the code for better readability and maintainability.
